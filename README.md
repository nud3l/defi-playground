## About

This repository is intended to kick-start new DeFi protocol deployments. It should help to setup a local development environment with all Ethereum contracts deployed without the need to go through each project's deploy scripts. Here are the cool features of this project:

- No need to deploy smart contracts yourself, just start the local blockchain and have all your favourite DeFi protocols available.
- A standard interface to get the contract's ABIs to use in your own projects.
- Quickly deploy new apps and smart contracts.
